# Spotify Search App</br>

## Project Overview:

#### The Spotify Search App is a web application that allows users to search for an artist, album, or song through the Spotify API. You must have a Spotify account to log in and access their media. Once a search query has been entered into the search bar, the user is redirected to the search results page where they can view and listen to what they searched. This project employs MongoDB (database) in order to track and keep up with OAuth JSON web tokens.

## Getting Started
    
 #### You must have a ```.env``` file to run the application. This file allows sensitive information, such as user credentials, to be stored in a local environment. This file should be added to a ```.gitignore``` file so that it is not uploaded to code repositories online for everyone to read. This can be achieved by making a copy of the ```.env.dist``` file and change the name to ```.env``` by running the following command in terminal:
 ```javascript
cp .env.dist .env && vim .env
```
#### Next, you must add your own environment variables inside the file.
#### The next step is to add the dependencies (node modules) by running the following command:
```javascript 
npm install
```
#### Once all dependencies have been installed, you can run the project. You must open two terminal windows, one for the frontend and one for the backend.

## To Run Next.js 
```javascript
npm run dev
```
